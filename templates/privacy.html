        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            InSite QR Signs ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.
            This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our
            QR code yard sign service.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3 class="legal-subheading">For Agents (Account Holders)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Email, name, brokerage, phone number, profile photo</li>
            <li><strong>Property Data:</strong> Addresses, descriptions, photos of listed properties</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Processed securely via Stripe; we do not store card details</li>
            <li><strong>Order History:</strong> Sign orders, sizes, colors, shipping addresses</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="legal-subheading">For Buyers (QR Scanners)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>QR Scan Analytics:</strong> Timestamp, IP address, user agent, device type, referrer URL</li>
            <li><strong>Page Views:</strong> Which property pages are viewed and when</li>
            <li><strong>Lead Form Submissions:</strong> Name, email, phone, message (only when voluntarily submitted)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Analytics & Tracking Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
            When you scan a QR code on one of our signs or view a property page, we collect:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Used to derive approximate location for geographic analytics</li>
            <li><strong>User Agent:</strong> Browser and device information</li>
            <li><strong>Referrer URL:</strong> Where the visitor came from (e.g., UTM parameters)</li>
            <li><strong>Visitor Hash:</strong> A privacy-preserving identifier to count unique visitors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We use a session cookie to distinguish between property page views from logged-in agents
            (dashboard activity) and views from potential buyers (public interest). This prevents
            agent activity from being counted as buyer interest in analytics.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To generate and fulfill QR code yard sign orders</li>
            <li>To provide agents with analytics about property interest</li>
            <li>To connect potential buyers with listing agents (via lead forms)</li>
            <li>To improve our service and user experience</li>
            <li>To process payments and prevent fraud</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We share information only in these cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Agents:</strong> Lead submissions and property view analytics are shared with the listing
                agent</li>
            <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> Print fulfillment companies receive order details to produce
                signs</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Stripe processes payments according to their privacy policy</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law or to protect rights</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We retain account and order data as long as needed to provide our service.
            Analytics data (QR scans, page views) is retained for up to 2 years.
